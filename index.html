        <p>A typing test where you type a fixed passage until the end.
You can attempt it as many times as you like, and your best, worst, and average results will be displayed.</p>
        <p>Pressing Enter three times lets you cancel the current attempt.</p>

      <dd>
        <p>A typing test where you type a fixed passage until the end.</p>
        <p>There is a limit on the number of mistyped character indices allowed, as well as a minimum KPM (keystrokes per minute) threshold you must meet. If you exceed the mistype limit or fall below the KPM threshold, the attempt fails.</p>
        <p>When you pass an attempt, the KPM threshold increases. When you fail an attempt, how the KPM threshold changes depends on the settings.</p>
        <p>By specifying a value for <code>prompt</code> in the URL parameters, you can choose the passage to type. By specifying <code>threshold</code> in the URL parameters, you can change the initial KPM threshold.</p>
        <p>There is a minimum guaranteed number of attempts you can always take. There is also a minimum number of successful attempts required to complete the test.</p>
        <p>After completing the minimum guaranteed attempts, if all attempts so far have been successful, you may continue attempting until you fail.</p>
