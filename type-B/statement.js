  en_sentence: "Bob loved the piano. His only audience was his mother, but he never minded that. Alice did not like the violin. Her quiet, daily practice felt like a small beginning before a big stage someday. Alice loved Bob's piano music. It was free, warm, and bright like the sun. Bob loved Alice's violin. It was delicate, and he could feel a hidden passion behind her calm face."
